‚úÖ Template Matching
Pros:
 - Simple and Easy to Implement
 - Just requires a reference crater image (template) and applies cv2.matchTemplate().
 - Works Well with Known Shapes
 - Detects craters that resemble the template accurately, making it ideal for repeated patterns.
 - Fast for Small Image Sets
 - Efficient on moderate-size images without needing heavy preprocessing.

Cons:
 - Not Rotation or Scale Invariant
 - Cannot detect craters if they appear rotated or of different size than the template.
 - Sensitive to Lighting and Noise
 - Minor changes in lighting or contrast affect the accuracy of detection.

‚úÖ Isomorphic Approach
Pros:
 - Handles Geometric Variations
 - Can detect craters with slight shape deformities or transformations.
 - Robust to Rotation and Perspective
 - Identifies structurally similar patterns regardless of orientation.
 - Ideal for Complex Patterns
 - Works well with craters having irregular edges or overlapping regions.

Cons:
 - Complex and Computationally Intensive
 - Requires more resources and advanced geometric matching algorithms.
 - Difficult to Tune Parameters
 - Needs careful adjustment of thresholds and descriptors for optimal results.

‚úÖ Hough Circle Transform
Pros:
 - Detects Perfect Circles Accurately
 - Works well when craters appear as clean circular shapes.
 - Scale and Rotation Invariant
 - Can identify circles of varying radii and orientations.
 - Good for Preprocessing
 - Can be used to suggest potential crater regions for further analysis.

Cons:
 - Fails with Irregular Shapes or Noise
 - Misses deformed or partially visible craters.
 - Needs Edge Detection Preprocessing
 - Performance heavily depends on the quality of edge detection (like Canny).

üèÜ Why Template Matching is Best for This Project
 - Targeted Accuracy: Since craters often follow a consistent shape, template matching gives high precision when using a properly chosen reference.

 - Low Complexity: Ideal for deployment in a lightweight application where resources are limited.

 - Quick Implementation: Allowed rapid prototyping and testing of the detection pipeline in the project timeline.

üëâ Despite its limitations, template matching delivers the best trade-off between accuracy, speed, and simplicity for your current use case ‚Äî especially where the goal is to identify known crater shapes from TMC images and match coordinates accordingly.
